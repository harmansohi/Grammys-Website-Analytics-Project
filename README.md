This is a portfolio project I made towards the end of my time in the Global Career Accelerator.
In this project, we were given data for two different websites related to the Grammys, one being the Grammy's website and one being The Recording Academy's Website.
We were tasked to analyse this data in Python using the Pandas and Plotly Express libraries to determine if having the two websites be separate is beneficial for the Grammy's.
